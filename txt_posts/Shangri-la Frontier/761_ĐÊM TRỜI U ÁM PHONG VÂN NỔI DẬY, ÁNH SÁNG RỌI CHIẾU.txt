**ĐÊM TRỜI U ÁM: PHONG VÂN NỔI DẬY, ÁNH SÁNG RỌI CHIẾU**

Tác giả cũng đã thức trắng đêm để viết nên thật tình mà nói, tôi cứ nơm nớp lo liệu mọi thứ có ổn thỏa, có liền mạch không nữa.

◇

Giữa lúc tất thảy bạch xà đều cúi đầu, chỉ duy nhất một con rắn (đồ vô dụng) ngẩng mặt lên.

“... Người ơi,” nó khẩn cầu, “Xin người, xin người hãy giúp con!”

Nó cảm nhận được thời khắc sinh mệnh đang cận kề, biết rằng bản thân sẽ không còn cơ hội chứng kiến kẻ thù của chủ nhân phải trả giá. Nhưng nếu đã vậy, ít nhất...

“... Dừng lại đi, sao ngươi lại đến chỗ ta? Cứ để mặc ta đi chứ.”

Con rắn nhỏ không tài nào truyền lời tới bạch xà đang than khóc. Chỉ có linh thú có mối liên hệ mật thiết với bạch xà mới làm được điều đó, mà giờ đây, con rắn nhỏ bé này đã mất đi chủ nhân, chẳng còn ai để nó bày tỏ ý nguyện.

“Có cái thứ đó thì sao chứ? Ai mà thắng nổi? Chẳng lẽ chỉ còn cách bỏ cuộc thôi sao?”

Nhưng những điều ấy nào có quan trọng gì! Nó đâu có đến đây để tranh cãi chuyện thắng thua, đâu phải để giành giật sinh mạng. Ôi, một tiếng nứt lớn vang lên, phá vỡ sinh mệnh đang chống đỡ chính nó. Sức lực rời bỏ cơ thể, cái đầu nó yếu ớt đập mạnh xuống sàn, vẫn giữ nguyên tư thế cúi phục ban nãy.

“Ư, ư ư ư ư ư ư...!”

“—Xin người, xin người hãy giúp con!” Nó đâu cầu xin được cứu mạng, đâu đòi hỏi phải mang đầu kẻ thù đến ngay lập tức. Xin người, hãy kết nối! Trước khi ra đi, xin người hãy nhận lấy tâm nguyện của con rắn nhỏ bé này. Chỉ cần có ai đó nhận lấy nỗi oan ức này, ít nhất nó cũng có thể nhắm mắt xuôi tay.

Thời khắc sinh mệnh đã cận kề. Từ ngoài khung cửa sổ đang dần hé rạng, ánh sáng bình minh sắp sửa rọi chiếu vào.

“Không muốn nữa, không muốn không muốn không muốn không muốn... Con không muốn sợ hãi... Đừng bận tâm đến con nữa, đừng nhìn con nữa... Cứu con với...”

Chẳng ai chịu ngẩng mặt lên. Và cứ thế, thời gian trôi đi, trôi đi... cho đến khi đó—

Đánh trúng. Không trúng. Ngươi chết trước đi. Dù có dùng hàng trăm hàng ngàn lời để diễn tả chiến trường này, rốt cuộc cũng chỉ gói gọn trong ba điều đó.

“... My Lord,” it pleaded, “please, please help me!”

It felt its life rapidly nearing its end; there was no longer any hope of witnessing the demise of its master's foe. But if that was the case, then at the very least…

“... Stop it, why did you come to me? Just leave me alone.”

The small snake could not convey its words to the grieving white snake. Only kin with a close connection to the white snake could do so, and with its master already gone, there was no one left for the small snake to communicate with.

“Just because you have that... so what? No one can win, can they? There's nothing left but to give up.”

But that didn't matter. It hadn't scraped together its remaining life just to debate winning or losing. Ah, it heard a great crack in the life force that sustained it. The strength drained from its body, and its head slammed weakly against the floor, remaining in that posture.

“U, uuuuuhhh…!”

───Please, please help me. It wasn't asking for its life to be saved. It wasn't asking for the enemy's head to be brought to it immediately. Please, connect me. Before it died, it wanted someone to receive this small snake’s wishes. If only someone would acknowledge its sorrow, it could at least die with peace.

The end of its life was drawing near. From outside the dimly brightening window, light was beginning to break through.

“I don’t want this anymore, I don't want it, I don't want it, I don't want it, I don't want it... I don't want to be afraid... Just leave me alone, don't look at me... Please, save me...”

No one dared to look up. And so, as time was about to simply pass by───

◆

Hit. Miss. You die first. No matter how many hundreds, how many thousands of words one might use to describe this battlefield, in the end, it all boiled down to these three.

“DIEEEE!!!”

Even with its perceived weight reduced to the point of being wieldable with one hand, "Memento Mori" (Biệt Ly Vô Tư Tử), swung with both hands in a full arc, dealt significant damage to the left head of "Scarred" (Vết Sẹo Đỏ Thẫm), a heavy blow that could be called critical.

Yet, even with one of its heads—its own, its brother—suffering damage that nearly cleaved its face in half, the other two—no, all three heads, including the one that took the direct hit—boiled with killing intent, lunging at me, intent only on my demise.

“Hah! Hah!”

The trick to living well is not to be overly greedy. Having already initiated evasive maneuvers the moment my attack landed, I fled from the three-headed monster's fierce assault and re-gripped Memento Mori. I knew, I had known, but still... these past one or two hours were far more grueling than the several hours spent before dealing with the Monster Train. Was it because I couldn't heal? That was part of it. Was it because one hit could kill me? That was also true. But the biggest reason for this mental drain was not there.

What was the most terrifying aspect of Draculus Dino Saberus "Scarred"? Those who only knew of its existence by word of mouth might mention its multiple heads or its napalm attacks. But those who had actually fought it... and managed to put up a decent fight, would all give the same answer without hesitation.

“Defense strength inversely proportional to remaining HP...!”

As its name suggested, "Scarred" was covered in crimson wounds that looked as if blood might seep from them at any moment. The closer it came to death, the brighter, redder, and more vividly scarlet they glowed. As if proclaiming that life truly shined brightest at the precipice of death, its scales and muscles grew even more formidable. To put it very simply, if it had 100 HP, reducing it by 90 would increase its defense tenfold, making the remaining 10 HP effectively equivalent to 100.

Perhaps the Holy Lance, wielded by that despicable person who loves self-destruction, possessing some of the strongest defense-piercing capabilities in ShanFro, could even pierce through this creature's scales. But there was no such convenient spear here, and even if I could summon Pencilgton right now... I'd declare, absolutely not.

“What a fun time... isn’t that right, brother, isn’t it?!”

Ah, yes, at this very moment, I was having the absolute best time. Yes... it reminded me of Sabagan. On that isolated island, there were also those trash enemies that treated humans as mere bait or toys. Soloing and slaughtering those beasts, who lived solely on their inherent advantages, was far, far more enjoyable than assassinating ten people! Like challenging the Crystal Scorpions or the Sigmonia bugs, optimizing through killing and being killed was the essence of gaming... but still, the thrill of a first-time clear surpassed all else. Endorphins and adrenaline both surged through me; it was like 200% pure essence. Hahaha, what am I even saying.

“Good... my head’s starting to go crazy.”

This was the high typical of an all-nighter. If I lost now, I'd probably be kicking trash cans in frustration for the next three days, but if I won in this state, I could grin to myself from recalled memories for the next week. Indeed, when I took down the trash gorilla army led by Baiaal twenty times, I kept grinning at every opportunity.

“DIEEEE!!”

Burst forth. With an acceleration boost from a skill I’d used countless times, I plunged deep into "Scarred's" range. This acceleration, this evasive ability, was the thin thread holding my life in this world. Die quickly, die now, just die already. Imbuing the sword of epitaph with thoughts close to pure resentment, I relentlessly unleashed attacks. But it still wouldn't fall; its occasional stumbles confirmed I was cornering it. But... the remaining HP seemed impossibly far from zero. Could it be impossible? If the defense boost cap truly was ten times, then I'd have to replicate the damage I dealt over five hours all over again.

“Fuh, fuhuhu... fuhahaha, ahahahaha!!”

Oh no, it’s only now that I’m laughing at how ridiculously high-pitched my voice is. A smile is important, power through with a smile, sanity and madness are but one character apart! If one hit doesn't kill it, hit it a hundred times. If damage connects, a gamer can kill even a god. It no longer mattered if it was a weak spot or a tough spot; while fundamentally reliant on hit-and-run tactics, I attacked "Scarred" wherever an opportunity arose.

The sky began to lighten; a cool breeze caressed my cheek. No, perhaps it was a biting north wind. From "Scarred's" entire body, superheated white air shimmered like mist, and when an exceptionally strong gust blew───

“HERE IT COOOOMESSSSS!!!!”

The culmination of an all-night death match. The colossal body of Draculus Dino Saberus "Scarred," which seemed invincible, now unmistakably crumbled, unable to support its own weight.

Dead? No, dying! This is it, this is the only chance! Kill it here! Die here! Win here!

With "Memento Mori" raised high, discarding all minor tricks, I mentally begged the fading skill to hold on for two more seconds—a foolish and futile request—and charged straight towards "Scarred."

“My... victory, WHA–!?”

"Scarred" gagged, spitting something out. Was it blood? Or vomit? Too dark for blood, too viscous for vomit. Carried on the north wind, an overwhelmingly oily stench pierced my nostrils... This, this bastard is pulling out a new technique now──────

CLANG!!

If the previous viscous masses were flammable oil, then the black mass spat out now was those viscous masses compressed to their limit... a "Heavy Nitro" (Khối Dầu Nặng). A "Close-Range Self-Destruct Detonation" (kích nổ cận chiến cảm tử), something impossible unless one was willing to push further into death even when on the brink, determined to seize life.

There was no time to evade, even a backstep wouldn't suffice...

Then, the dark heavy oil mass swelled whitely, the sound vanished───

It exploded.

◇

Tĩnh mịch.

Draculus Dino Saberus "Scarred," một cá thể đặc biệt duy nhất với khả năng điều khiển "lửa," một sự trở lại cội nguồn của tổ tiên nó. Với cấu trúc cơ thể đặc biệt, nó có một cơ quan lưu trữ chất lỏng dễ cháy, nơi tích trữ chất béo hấp thụ từ con mồi, và từ đó, những khối dầu nặng được nén lại, khác với chất lỏng nhớt thông thường.

Chỉ khi bị dồn đến đường cùng, "Scarred" mới lần đầu tiên phô diễn hỏa lực cuối cùng và mạnh nhất của mình. Sức mạnh của nó ngang với một thiên thạch va chạm. Cú nổ kinh hoàng đến mức những người chơi khác, bị cuốn hút bởi âm thanh của trận chiến sinh tử kéo dài một đêm giữa Sanraku và "Scarred", đã bị thổi bay. Sức nóng đã tạo ra một khoảng đất hoang cháy rụi giữa một góc của khu rừng.

“Grrrrroooaar...!”

"Scarred" vẫn còn sống. Dù đầu bên trái hoàn toàn im lặng, và đầu bên phải gần như đã ngừng hoạt động, nhưng con rồng ba đầu đỏ thẫm đáng sợ vẫn kiên cường bám trụ ở bờ vực cái chết.

Vậy còn người duy nhất đã chiến đấu sinh tử với "Scarred" thì sao? Bình thường mà nói, không thể nào còn sống. Một vụ nổ lớn đến mức cây cối gãy đổ, mặt đất bị khoét sâu, và những người bị cuốn vào đều chết... không thể có sinh linh nào sống sót. Thêm vào đó, khối dầu nặng cũng có đặc tính giống như chất lỏng nhớt thông thường. Tức là, một ngọn lửa giống như bom napalm, một khi dính vào sẽ không bao giờ tắt dù có lăn lộn trên mặt đất. Giả sử, chỉ là giả sử, một người đã sống sót qua chấn động và sức nóng, thì ngọn lửa bám trên người sẽ ngay lập tức thiêu rụi cơ thể đang hấp hối.

Thế nhưng, "Scarred" không hề lơ là cảnh giác. Nó nhìn chằm chằm vào đám bụi, lòng tràn đầy đấu chí và sát ý, quyết không dừng lại cho đến khi thấy xác con mồi...

Và, nhanh hơn cả phản ứng của "Scarred" dù nó đã cảnh giác cao độ.

“The White Emperor once stated...”
“I see. So that is why that place has always been so beautiful. It's a miracle it hasn't been torn down and paved over for a parking lot, or heaven forbid a shopping mall. It seems that a certain city would rather be poor and quaint than rich and ugly. It is to be commended, for sure.”
“Indeed. Though, I also wonder if the locals simply have too much pride to allow outside development, even if it might benefit them financially. A stubborn pride, if you will.”
“Perhaps. But one must admire their resolve. It is a rare thing to see in this age of rampant consumerism and globalization.”
“True. It's a refreshing change of pace.”
“Precisely. Now, if you'll excuse me, I believe I have an appointment with a bowl of ramen.”
“Ah, a man after my own heart. Enjoy.”
The two men chuckled, their camaraderie evident in the easygoing exchange. They had known each other for years, their friendship forged in the crucible of shared experiences and mutual respect. Even though their paths had diverged in recent times, their bond remained unbroken. They were two old friends, meeting for a casual chat, as they had done countless times before. But as they parted ways, a sense of melancholy hung in the air. The world was changing, and they, like everyone else, were caught in the relentless tide of progress. They could only hope that their friendship, at least, would remain a constant in an ever-shifting landscape.
The younger man, a former student of the elder, watched his mentor walk away, a nostalgic smile playing on his lips. He remembered the countless hours they had spent together, discussing everything from philosophy to the latest scientific discoveries. The elder had always been a fount of knowledge, a beacon of wisdom who had guided him through the tumultuous waters of youth. He owed a great deal to this man, who had not only taught him the ways of the world but also helped him discover his own path. It was a debt he could never repay, but he would always cherish the memories they had shared.
He turned and headed in the opposite direction, his mind already drifting to the new challenges that awaited him. He was a man of ambition, a seeker of knowledge who was always striving for something more. But even as he pursued his goals, he would never forget the lessons he had learned from his mentor, nor the bond they had shared. For in the end, it was not the destination that mattered, but the journey, and the people who walked alongside him.
The elder man, meanwhile, made his way to a small ramen shop, its warmth and familiarity a welcome balm to his aging bones. He had seen much in his life, experienced both triumphs and failures, joy and sorrow. He had watched the world change around him, sometimes for the better, sometimes for the worse. But through it all, he had held on to his core values, his belief in the inherent goodness of humanity. He knew that the world was far from perfect, but he also believed that there was always hope, as long as people continued to strive for a better future.
He sat down at the counter, the aroma of the rich broth filling his nostrils. He had always loved ramen, not just for its taste but also for the comfort it brought. It was a simple dish, yet it held a profound meaning for him. It was a symbol of resilience, of finding joy in the small things, of enduring through adversity. As he savored each spoonful, he felt a sense of peace settle over him. The world might be changing, but some things, like the taste of a good bowl of ramen, would always remain the same.
The two men, though separated by distance and time, were connected by an invisible thread, a shared history that transcended the ordinary. They were like two stars in the vast expanse of the cosmos, each shining brightly in its own orbit, yet bound together by the invisible forces of friendship and respect. And as long as they continued to shine, their light would illuminate the path for others, guiding them through the darkness and into the embrace of a brighter tomorrow.
The story ends, but their journey continues. The world turns, seasons change, and life goes on. But the legacy of their friendship will endure, a timeless tale of camaraderie and mutual support. For in the grand tapestry of existence, it is these threads of connection that give meaning to our lives, weaving together the disparate elements into a beautiful and harmonious whole.
And so, as the sun sets and the stars begin to twinkle in the night sky, we are reminded that even in the vastness of the universe, there is always room for human connection, for the bonds that tie us together and make us truly alive. The journey continues, and with it, the endless possibilities of friendship, love, and understanding. And that, in itself, is a beautiful thing.
The end.

**Author's notes on recovery items**

Of course, in the world of Shangri-La Frontier (ShanFro), recovery items are not chemical concoctions that can be scientifically explained.

How the phenomenon of “recovery” is defined is what distinguishes the myriad of recovery items. For example, some “repair damage to its original state,” some “rewind to the state before the damage occurred,” and there are even those that “erase the very fact of ‘damage’ from the user’s body.”

There’s far too much that can’t be understood just by reading an item’s description. The liquid that soaked into the black attire didn’t merely resist the flames... it resisted the very “concept” that causes damage, and thus endured.

All that was left was to curl up, close one’s eyes and mouth, and endure. This was a "deranged" method of breakthrough, achievable only with a madness that clung to life even if it meant biting into the ground, in a moment where one couldn't even perceive death.
