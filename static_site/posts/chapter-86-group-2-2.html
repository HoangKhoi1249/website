  <pre>[86] Group (2)
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you think so? What the hell is this magic? not like a teacher At this rate, everyone will freeze to death.‚Äù
Nade was equally puzzled. Now there are hundreds of students here. I didn‚Äôt think they could survive long in the cold of minus 20 degrees. However, the effect of putting pressure on Lucas was excellent. This is because when the somatic cells are cooled, the mitochondrial build becomes less effective.
‚Äúdamn! driving me crazy!‚Äù
Especially in the place where Lucas was, there was even a strong wind, so the perceived temperature was even lower. Necrosis was progressing from the peripheral nerve.
This was the reason why high-level freezing wizards started fighting with Blizzard by default. Its killing power is not great, but it is a wide range magic and it gives fixed damage called cooling, so it was essential before the great swordsman.
‚ÄúAnyway, I‚Äôm annoyed. Wizards.‚Äù
Lucas was fed up with wizards who harassed swordsmen with all kinds of strange magic. But it wasn‚Äôt the time to give up. More than anything, she wasn‚Äôt just normal in her condition.
As the sharp ice spear flew through the blizzard, Lucas hurriedly threw himself away. However, due to his weakened mitochondrial build, he was unable to dodge completely and grazed his side.
‚ÄúDamn it!‚Äù
Most organisms become less active at low temperatures. In addition, as he braved the cold and swung his sword, his fingertips already had symptoms of erythematous frostbite.
‚ÄòI think the temperature has dropped more. Are you really trying to kill them all?‚Äô
If the schema users suffered from frostbite, the students should have already frozen to death. But in reality, only Lucas was trapped in Blizzard. Suddenly, a blizzard with a narrower radius was following him, focusing on it.
Lucas, completely unaware of such a fact, bared his teeth at Shiina, who appeared through the blizzard.
‚ÄúAre you crazy? How long will this beggarly blizzard‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ .‚Äù
Lucas stopped talking. Shiina‚Äôs eyes still contained nothing. She has no emotions, no thoughts, no ego.
‚Äúno way‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ .‚Äù
Lucas‚Äô shoulders trembled. He remembers magic with his body, not his head.
Literally, the brain.
Just as prosecutors acquire skills through endless repetitive training, they have reached the stage of embodying specific brain wave patterns even in situations where poetry or memory is lost.
repeat, repeat again. After all, he must have driven his spirit to death without rest from the time he was born until now.
‚ÄòHow long has this woman trained?‚Äô
The hair on his head stood on end. Regardless of her skills, the path of Sura she had walked was drawn in her mind.
‚Äòshit! It‚Äôs not like stepping on shit, this.‚Äô
should get out of here No matter how good the gold coins were, they were just pieces of metal in front of their lives.
Lucas drew all his strength and ran away. If he got out of Blizzard, he wouldn‚Äôt be able to catch up. However, his thoughts were delusional, and as a result, he had to pay a heavy price for turning his back on a certified 6th class wizard.
Shiina raised a finger and pointed at Lucas, and after a while Lucas screamed and was buried in the snow.
‚ÄúQuaaaaaa!‚Äù
There was no pain. However, the two legs were missing from Schema‚Äôs human body diagram, as if they had been cut off with scissors. Lucas twisted his back to examine his legs. I couldn‚Äôt feel the slightest sensation in my frozen legs.
‚ÄòNo, that‚Äôs ridiculous.‚Äô
It was absolute zero (absolute zero), which had only been heard through rumors.
Freezing magic is a magic that extremely restricts the activity of particles through preservation and condensation, which can be said to be the best battery.
By realizing the realm of Absolute Zero, Shiina became a certified 6th-class wizard at the age of only 20.
However, it was a magic that required enormous mental power to the extent that even she could only produce a localized effect.
‚ÄòDamn it! It‚Äôs a crappy school‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ Students, teachers, they are all monsters!‚Äô
Shiina cast the next spell with a calm expression. It was the advanced magic glacier bombing (glacier bombardment) derived from the battery of preservation condensation. As dozens of huge ice blocks were born in the sky, the blood on Lucas‚Äô face went away. My legs are frozen and there is no way to escape. I have no choice but to surrender my life to the will of Heaven.
Nade and Iruki ran to the students. It wasn‚Äôt wide-area magic, but the size of the glacier was so large that I couldn‚Äôt be relieved. An almond-shaped chunk of glacier began to fall on top of the students as the ice blocks that froze at different points pushed each other as slowly as their heavy masses.
Nade ran to Arin and grabbed her by the shoulder and knocked her to the floor.
‚ÄúKyaaak! what are you doing!‚Äù
‚ÄúEvacuate the students! Otherwise, everyone will die!‚Äù
‚Äúno! Time is running out!‚Äù
Iruki interrupted the two of them and shouted.
‚ÄúI‚Äôll do it!‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat are you going to do?‚Äù
Iruki gritted his teeth without even having time to answer. Is it really possible? It was a glacier weighing several tens of tons. Even if it was exploded with an atomic bomb, the fragments that were split into dozens were a problem. Calculated by the size of the glacier, it was not a matter of breaking a human head unless it was broken into at least 1,000 pieces.
‚ÄòI have no choice but to try‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ .‚Äô
Momentum can be predicted mathematically. If you calculate all the physical quantities of splitting the glacier, splitting it again, and splitting it again, you should be able to explode it before it crashes.
‚ÄúGoaaaaaa!‚Äù
The Breakaway Spirit Zone dug into the center of the glacier. When the atomic spring exploded through the detonation process of the available limit value, the glacier was excited and split into seven chunks.
Iruki activated Double Spirit Zone. Then, frantically firing Atomic Bombs, the glacier exploded.
Puff puff puff puff puff!
The ice flower is in full bloom. As the glacier burst, it was separated into fragments, which then exploded and scattered like fireworks.
Nade and Arin watched in awe as the chain of explosions unfolded in the sky. Then, realizing the ice pellets were pouring out of the hood, he turned his head to the students. Small fragments fell like hail, but no one was injured.
Arin‚Äôs eyes shook in shock. Arcane always disparaged the magic school students. Weak students who take whatever they are given without a spirit of challenge or the will to fight. However, the level of magic school students she experienced herself far exceeded her expectations.
‚ÄòThis is a magic school. what?‚Äô
Arin turned his head. When she realized that she was cradled on the chest of an outsider, she reluctantly pushed Nade away, she screamed.
‚Äúgo away! what are you doing!‚Äù
Nade‚Äôs face flushed red as he hit his butt.
‚ÄúWhat, what am I! He helped me at best!‚Äù
‚ÄúWhy are you helping me! We are enemies!‚Äù
‚ÄúWho said what? Release the mind control quickly! Are you really going to kill all these people? Are you still sane?‚Äù
Arin bit his lip. After today, I will be the main character of a massacre that will be recorded in history, but I was not afraid. Had she not met Kanis in Radum anyway, she would have been doomed to the brink of misery.
‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt care. If it‚Äôs for Canis, even if the whole world dies.‚Äù
Nade read the futility and arsenic in Arin‚Äôs eyes. What kind of life have you lived to be able to look like this?
‚ÄúYoung car.‚Äù
Iruki carried Shiina, who had fallen in the snow, on his back. And I turned to Lucas. Does God really exist even for the wicked? He was wedged between glaciers, barely a few meters apart. But he was so angry that his chin was missing and he could only see the whites of his eyes. He lost both legs, so stealing is impossible. In the end, he was the one who would return to the gloomy prison of Inferno after 7 days of jailbreak.
Phew!
Ned and Iruki turned their heads at the roar that erupted from the forest. A thick beam of light soared through the sea of trees.
‚Äúwow. What is so big?‚Äù
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a photon cannon. Have you ever had an epiphany?‚Äù
The forest shuddered, and Sirone came out as if spitting out.
Arin‚Äôs face turned red as he looked as if he had just come out of the mud. It was clear that Kanis had the victory.
But her expectations were dashed.
As Harvest fell the trees on the left and right with his long arms, Canis limped out. It was more than Sirone‚Äôs condition, but by no means less.
Iruki said in disbelief.
‚Äúwhistle‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ is it?‚Äù
‚ÄúNonsense. Sirone‚Äôs photon cannon evolved during battle. Still can‚Äôt win?‚Äù
Sirone stood up from the ground and said.
‚ÄúI can‚Äôt win.‚Äù
Friends doubted their ears. Perhaps it was the first word he had heard since meeting Sirone?
‚ÄúWhat, man? Don‚Äôt speak weakly.‚Äù
‚ÄúIt is not a weak sound. that child‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ Really strong.‚Äù
Sirone frankly admitted. He would have been more convinced if he knew that he was a disciple of the Archmage, but even if he didn‚Äôt know it, he could feel his will in each and every magic.
Willingness not to lose. The will to destroy humans. Willingness to prove that you are the best.
The power of the Photon Cannon was maximized, but Harvest, who borrowed Canis‚Äô spiritual power, absorbed even that.
From then on, it was a brawl. He fought a battle of attrition by exchanging the Power of Darkness and the Photon Cannon.
In the end, Kanis successfully countered and pushed Sirone out of the forest.
‚ÄòSo strong‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ Why do you want to harm people?‚Äô
If you chose to be evil for whatever reason, you can. Because all humans make mistakes.
However, he could not admit that the evil was strong. Because strength is the product of hard work, not mistakes.
‚ÄúWhy are you doing this? What are you saying the students did to you?‚Äù
‚ÄúAre you kicking it with your mouth because it‚Äôs out of power? A typical pattern of weak nobles.‚Äù
Since it wasn‚Äôt true, Sirone didn‚Äôt get angry.
‚ÄúAnswer me. What you are about to do is so terrible that it will go down in history. At least I need to hear the reason.‚Äù
‚Äúhistory? Who cares about that? The abandoned are just holding on to live their day. Because if I don‚Äôt kill someone, I will die.‚Äù
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt try to justify it with sophistry. No matter what kind of life you have lived, there is no one in the world who is not having a hard time. Everyone has to live with the unbearable pain one by one.‚Äù
‚Äúyou. Have you ever eaten feces that fell on the ground?‚Äù
Sirone shut his mouth. A cold wind blew.
‚ÄòCanis‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ .‚Äô
Arin‚Äôs eyes were filled with sadness. Those who have not lived in Radum will never know what Radum is like.
It was another world separated from the world.
Kanis and Arin had been abandoned there. I don‚Äôt remember when we were together or why we were the two of us.
However, they were there from the moment they came to their senses, and even while other friends died or were sold, they survived.
Canis was smart from an early age. Even though he was a powerless child, he showed himself how strong a human being can become when his talent and virility meet.
There was only one thing Kanis wanted in Radum, which was teeming with villains.
Protecting Arin today.
Women do not exist in Radum. To be precise, she was a woman past infancy.
In places where food is extremely scarce, helpless girls are bound to be eaten as soon as they are born.
However, Arin survived in Radum until the age of ten.
Radum‚Äôs only female.
It was Canis who protected the eerie symbol.
He was always barking like a mad dog. When an enemy appears aiming for Arin, he rushes at him with the determination to die.
I couldn‚Äôt join any organization with Arin. So he lived by sifting through trash cans day after day.
What‚Äôs really funny is that even trash in Radum has an owner. I fought, refusing to tear my flesh to get the dregs that others had discarded.
After such a fierce fight, Canis managed to get half of the moldy bread.
