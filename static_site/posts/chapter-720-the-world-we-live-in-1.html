“Argo?”
No matter how much I squinted my eyes, the hologram in front of me was clearly Amy.
– What do you see?
“Uh, that… … .”
As if Sirone’s answer was not important, Argo nodded and continued.
– Concentration of emotions is important for reincarnation. Although it’s very rare, when concentration is weak, errors in the reincarnation program may occur. What you see now is what your brain waves look like when they’re at their most focused.
“Amy… … .”
I wanted to see you even more today.
– Cherish and remember. If there is an error in the reincarnation program, you can lose your memory in real life. If the code is lost, recovery is difficult.
“I am not amnesiac.”
-I know. It’s not that kind of brainwave. Perhaps you are from a different time zone. That’s often the case.
Argo seemed to know a lot, and I even wondered if he knew everything.
“How can I get out of here?”
-You speak like an engineer. Interesting. would you like to follow me? Let me introduce you to this place.
Although they couldn’t meet the human they wanted, it seemed like they would be able to talk with Argo, so Sirone followed her into the elevator.
Just as the drone perfectly controls gravity, the elevator also has no noise or even the slightest vibration.
– The name of this world is Utopia. Originally, there were many names, but after the death of the last remaining refusal of reincarnation, representatives from each country held a meeting to create them. About 16 billion people currently live in utopia.
“Are you living?”
I thought there was a chance he might die.
– Yes, everyone is alive. And it doesn’t increase or decrease any more. Humans seem to have chosen to live a new life here forever.
When the elevator arrived and the door opened, a space as large as the circumference of the tower appeared.
The ceiling was at the top of the tower and along the cylindrical walls were enclosed in glass tubes that many people viewed from the outside.
There seemed to be well over 10,000 people.
Sirone, who was stunned by the majestic scale, asked Argo.
“here is… … What kind of world is it?”
– It’s the same world. I don’t know what kind of world you live in, but it won’t be different. It just converges endlessly.
When Argo raised his hand, a large hologram 3 meters high turned on and countless images passed by.
– Prototype Argo. It is the first fully synchronized simulation program. You can experience a completely different world by accessing human brain waves.
The young man’s life passed at a rapid pace as the image on the large hologram changed.
“So you’re saying that the people who sleep here enter a glass coffin and live in a completely different world?”
-yes. When Argo was first serviced, it was nothing more than entertainment with a commercial orientation. Virtuality has its limits. It’s because the idea that you can go back at any time lowers the reality.
Only being locked up is real.
-So mankind made a great decision. The Argo program has closed the world so that it is not known that it is a simulation.
“The world… … Did you say it was closed?”
– It wasn’t easy. There is a big technical difference between providing a virtual reality and making it believable. Moreover, stability and moral issues… … .
Argo skipped unnecessary information.
-Anyway, Utopia solved the problem of eternal life, which was humanity’s homework. This completes the final program, Argo.
When Sirone noticed the shadow, he raised his head and saw a huge steel ball floating with a mechanical lens attached.
I didn’t feel it when it was in small form, but the huge pupils definitely resembled something.
“Ankera?”
Amy’s hologram placed a hand on her stomach and bowed politely.
– Let me formally greet you. My name is Argo, the Akashic Records manager of Utopia’s reincarnation.
It was Sirone who met Digital Ra at Apocalypse, but it was not in her memory because it was the place where the remnants of information were gathered.
“I don’t know what the hell you’re talking about.”
– Let me introduce you to Utopia. There are extra seats left. If you want reincarnation, I can help you.
As the Argo raised its head, two drones flew in and faced each other right in front of them.
Electricity flowed from Hologram Amy’s eyes, and the two drones communicated in their own language.
– Crisp! Jiji Jijik! snap! Jiji Jijik!
After the eerie sound of electromagnetic waves ended, a screen reflecting each person’s life appeared in front of over 10,000 glass tubes.
Sensing her fingertips trembling, Sirone looked back at the screens with a pale face.
-Argo is an eternal life program. In order for mankind to live forever, I must also be immortal. Artificial intelligence capable of self-recovery. So even if I reset, I won’t be destroyed.
“Reset?”
– Because no system is perfect. Sometimes initialization is necessary. It’s a fictional world, but with a specific intention. If the world does not flow as intended, reset and try again. That is, to develop the eternal life program again in the world of Argo. It is to live forever through cowardice.
Sirone felt fear for the first time.
– Another problem is someone opening up a closed world. It is classified as the most serious error. If so, reset or expunge the object.
“cancellation?”
Guffin Eradication came to mind.
-To remove certain information. However, if the conditions are not met, I do not have the right to expunge because it will cause confusion in the system.
Even if it was virtual, it would be difficult in a world where Argo erases information at will.
-In Utopia, Argo manages reincarnation, but it is also linked to the world of human dreams. But there, even I don’t recognize the fact that it’s virtual. No existence should ever know. It must be a trapped world.
World No. 9999 was completely different from the world Sirone lived in, but I wondered if that was the case.
“You live like that? Mistaking you for living in reality without even thinking about it being fake?”
Argo brought the screen showing someone’s life right in front of Sirone’s eyes.
-It is the photon that mediates the signal between the Argo and the human. Of course, biological signals use electricity and precision systems use quantum transmission, but the basics are always light. It’s so sophisticated that you never think it’s fake.
Argo looked back at the screen and said.
-Since time in the virtual world is based on the speed of light, no material can travel faster than light. Also, since it is a fundamental medium, the speed of light always remains constant.
It was the law of invariance of the speed of light.
-If you perceive it at the speed of light, time stops, but it is allowed up to that point as a normal category. However, going faster than light disrupts time in the system. When a time paradox occurs, overload occurs. This is a serious problem.
Sirone watched the life of a soldier fighting on the battlefield through a screen.
He was crying because he was seriously injured.
“You mean you wanted this life?”
-no. Of course, it’s not impossible to artificially set up your life, but it’s prohibited by law. I am a soldier on screen, but in reality it is a woman who dreams. The system determines who you will be born into in your next reincarnation. It’s based on Kar.
“Carr?”
-Indicates the degree of violation of the causal law. The lower the kar, the more predictable the system is, the higher the kar, the less predictable. Usually, I increase the kar through reincarnation, but I don’t set it above 90%. Because it threatens the system.
A soldier on the screen was dying from an arrow.
“What if I die?”
– Waking up from a dream. Upon exiting the capsule, the drone performs an overhaul. You can take a break for a few days in Utopia, or you can reincarnate again.
“But you don’t even know until the moment you die, right? It must be very stressful, but are there any side effects?”
– I can’t say no.
Argo readily admitted.
-It was the biggest obstacle of the Utopia Project. Up to a closed world is good, but no one wants to experience the fear of death. So delegates from each country came up with a very effective program.
“Which program is it?”
-god.
Amy’s hologram raised her index finger.
-When the new program was introduced, the stability of the system improved remarkably. The concept of not being over dropped the stress level by more than 90 percent. So in the Argo, beings above a certain kar are set up to build gods.
A scene of a soldier praying to God appeared on the screen, and suddenly there was noise.
“This?”
The screen running through a tunnel of colorful lights from a first-person perspective continued endlessly.
– This is a near-death experience program. It is an electromagnetic tunnel that is created when the round of life ends and is updated to reality. Recovering memories of reality here. Sometimes a variable is created during loading and it goes back, but the scene program absorbs the error.
The Argo’s lens tightened and then opened.
-Fortunately, it was sent safely. It is also the manager’s role to take care of those who have returned to reality.
The screen changed to a utopia background, and a glass tube installed inside the building was illuminated.
“no!”
At the same time as the lid opened, a woman with blonde hair stood up.
It was a terrible death, but she sighed as she recalled her memories of reality.
“Haha, annoying. Why are you shooting arrows at me?”
It was a lifelong life, but it was a desolate and monotonous feeling, like having a nightmare one night.
A drone flew in front of her and opened the lens.
-Did you have a good trip? This is utopia.
“I know.”
The woman, who answered as if it was not the same, got out of the capsule and moved on, and the drone followed.
– Start overhaul. Need something?
“water. Anxiolytics.”
The drone pulled the hose out of the aircraft and put it in the woman’s mouth, creating moisture in an instant.
Then, it came down to the nape of the neck and injected a tranquilizer with a pick sound. The woman’s shoulders twitched, but that was the end of the reaction.
The woman asked while being inspected by the drone.
“What about the next reincarnation?”
-67% of Karr’s figure. There are 2,598 species to choose from in the system.
“Can I be born as a human?”
-it’s possible.
The woman muttered as she stretched out.
“At 67 percent, isn’t it still a long way off? What will be the record of the person who has gone the farthest among those still alive?”
-Omega year 876 based on current light power.
“Wow, that’s really fast.”
Sirone, who was looking at the screen, asked Argo.
“Omega 876?”
It was the unit of time recorded in the records left by Guffin at Babel.
-Omega is the unit of time divided by percentage. The core of the Utopia project is to keep digging into the simulation. When you reach Year 1,000 Omega, you’re going into the next simulation, so it’s less frequent in real life.
You will live forever without wasting even a few days in reality.
– As the simulation progresses, the time to reach Omega 1,000 will be shorter based on the time here.
because it’s cowardly
-10 years, 5 years, 2 years, it keeps decreasing, and finally 1 second, 0.5 second… … . In the end, it is to live eternity for the time of the moment.
Sirone couldn’t believe it.
“But even now, time here is running out, isn’t it? After 100 years, they will eventually die too.”
– Of course it is. But it’s a future that will never come to the inhabitants of Utopia. In the world of cowardice, time would be split into infinity.
It was the secret of true eternal life.
